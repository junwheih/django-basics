# My Beginner notes

### Creating a requirement.txt
1. I am using venv so no pipfile.lock etc
2. $ pip3 freeze > requirements.txt

### Starting a project : Page 18-19
$ django-admin startproject config .
1. The config/settings.py file controls our projectâ€™s settings
2. urls.py tells Django which pages to build in response to a browser or URL request, and 
3. wsgi.py, which stands for Web Server Gateway Interface helps Django serve our eventual web pages
4. manage.py executes various Django commands such as running the local web server or creating a new app
5. asgi.py allows for an optional Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface34 to be run.

### Migration : Page 21
$ manage.py migrate
1. Django is complaining that we have not yet migrated, or configured, our initial database

### Creating the first app : Page 22-23
$ python manage.py startapp appname
1. admin.py     : Configuration file for the built-in Django Admin app, where we register our model
2. apps.py      : Configuration file for the app itself
3. /migrations  : Keep track of any changes to the models file so it sync with the database (sqlite3)
4. tests.py     : Testing for the current app
5. views.py     : Handle the respone/request logic for the webapp

### Add your app to the config/settings.py : Page 24
```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'pages', # Adding the newly created app  <--- Add here
]
```
1. The URLpattern specifies a view which then determines the content for the page (usually from a database model) and then ultimately a template for styling and basic logic. The end result is sent back to the user as an HTTP response.
- URL -> View -> Model (typically) -> Template
2. Meaning that django takes in 4 files for a given page, 3 files if model is not needed
3. views    : Determine which content to be displayed on the given page
4. URLConfs : Determine where the page is going
5. mdoel    : contains the content from the database
6. template : styling for the content

### Edit the pages/views.py
```
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

# Create your views here.
def homePageView(request):
    return HttpResponse('This works')
```

### Creating a urls.py in your app
1. $ type nul > urls.py
2. Add the following item
```
from django.urls import path
from .views import homePageView

urlpatterns = [
    path('', homePageView, name='home'), 
]
```

### Update config/urls.py
1. After creating the app and set up the urls on the app, we need to add pages.urls into the config/urls.py
```
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('pages.urls')) # Newly added
]
```
2. When the user request for a url, it will first go to the config/urls.py to check the url, is the url exists, it will go to the specified apps' urls.py to check the sub url then response with a view of the app

### Git
$ git init      : Initialize it.
$ git status    : Checking the current status of the working directory
$ git add .     : Tracking the current file
$ git add -A    : Adding all the file

### Adding git alias
1. Find .gitconfig under user directory and edit
```
[alias]
	st = status
	a = add
	b = branch
	c = commit
	co = checkout
	cob = checkout -b
	alias = config --get-regexp alias
```
2. Next time to check status
$ git st
